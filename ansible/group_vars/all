# List of host(s) with their associated hostnames, web_roots, etc. Able to support multiple sites.
#
#    hostname: Should end in .dev. We're creating a wildcard SSL certificate behind the scenes so
#              follow the naming convention of site.property.dev (ex: admin.smh.dev or
#              accessportal.pearson.dev).
#
#    web_root: Where the files will live on the box. Vagrant will sync the folder specified in 'path'
#			         to this directory.
#
#    document_root: For vhosts. The location of where the document root lives. For Laravel the
#		                document_root is the web_root plus '/public'. For EE, it is the web_root plus
#                   '/app/html'.
#
#    path: Where the files live on your machine. The primary site's path is '.'. If what you're working
#          on needs multiple sites each subsequent path must match the name of the repository excluding
#          .git one level up.
#
#          NOTE: Remember the name of the folder because you will need it in the provision.sh script.
#                you will need it in the provision.sh script.
#
#          Ex: git@s4mh.git.beanstalkapp.com:/s4mh/screening-ee.git
#                                                 |<-- this -->|
#              path would be ../screening-ee
#
#    git_repo: When the main project needs other site(s) to "offically" work, add the repository url.
#              The primary site does not need one as you've either already cloned it or are working
#              on a brand new project.
