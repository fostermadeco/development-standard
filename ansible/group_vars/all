# Use this if you are including a task that creates a vhost (the Minio
# task, for example) to ensure that the additional hostname is added to
# your local hosts file. It also ensures the hostname is added to the
# self-signed SSL certificate. Adding a host here will not actually
# create a vhost for you.
